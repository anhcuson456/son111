                <p>
                    Origami originated from China and was popularized in Japan. It is the art of paper folding.
                    Paper-folding
                    is a wonderful hobby and a wonderful group activity... and for kids it has so many benefits
                    socially and
                    for the developing mind. You get to make cool stuff - with only a sheet of paper! <br />
                    <br />
                    It's incredible to watch an ordinary piece of paper transforming into a three dimensional
                    form, and the
                    more complex the design, the more incredible this process becomes... <br />
                    <br />
                    Origami can range from the super complex with realistic models to the simple models that are
                    more easy to
                    fold, but yet very recognizable.
                    Here we are aiming to design a website “OrigamiForAll” which will provide an easy way to
                    learn origami
                    with various designs and steps involved.
